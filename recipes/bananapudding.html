            <p class="des">Get ready for some yummy banana pudding! This will taste just as good as Magnolia's, and you can bring it to your next family gathering to wow the crowd. It's super simple to make, and you probably won't have to store any leftovers.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>6 egg yolks</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>9 ripe banans</li>
                <li>2 boxes vanialla wafers</li>
                <li>6 egg whites</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)</li>
                <li>Peel and slice bananas. Line the bottom and sides of 2 (9x13-inch) broiler-safe casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers, smoothing top with a knife or spatula.</li>
                <li>For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, covering it completely.</li>
                <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)</li>
                <li>Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill, covered, up to 4 days.)</li>
            </ol>
