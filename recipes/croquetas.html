        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 dry cured chorizo</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>50g Manchego cheese</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 cups of flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Panco for breading</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by chopping your onion and adding to your pan with some oil. Let them lightly cook down for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once your onions begin to brown, slowly add 1 cup of flor (in small parts) to the pan until it is absorbed into the onions.</li>
            <li>Once flour is added, add in milk in small parts until 1 cup is added to the pan. It will boil, then coagulate into the flour and onion mixture until you have a creamy filling.</li>
            <li>Take your pan off the heat and mix in grated manchego and chopped cured chorizo.</li>
            <li>Add your filling to a pan, cover with plastic wrap, and let it cool in the fridge for about an hour, or until completely cold.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, removed mixture and use your hands to form it into small round ovals. Bread them using flour, then egg, then panco, and st onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and lightly fry croquetas in small batches. Serve warm!</li>
